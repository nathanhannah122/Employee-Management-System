      Cookies Policy 
      Shipley College maintains continuous logs of web server activity. Logs include information about your IP address, your browser type and the pages you have visited. We use this information to analyse the way people use our website. 
      <br><br>
      What are cookies? Cookies are small files that are placed on a computer to allow a website to collect data about your use of the site. They can track your progress through the site and any actions you take. The information stored doesn't make you personally identifiable, it's anonymised. So, for example, we can see reports which show us where visitors come from, which pages they visit and track clicks on our website, but we won't be able to tie that data up to see what named individuals do on our website.
